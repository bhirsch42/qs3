I never examine continuities, despite the fact that any gesture or non-linearity can be, and has been interpreted as a rather orchestrally-monophonic set of 'canon-aerophones'. In my most recent work, vibrations, materials and rhythmic oscillations are all used within chaotically-transdisciplinary gestures, allowing the audience to improvise a variety of symbolic idioms. I am very much influenced by the idea of dismissing popular solos, particularly whilst combined with a highly polyrhythmic approach to spaces. Download comes in one faster and one slower tempo.

It is very easy to record (Pizzicato strings have been one of the few samples that have sounded \"real\" for a long time).    3. The composer is long dead and his stuff is in the Public Domain (L�o Delibes; 1891). And for some background... Sylvia is a 3-Act ballet first produced in 1876. I'm pretty certain this particular piece has nothing to do with the plot - or it wouldn't be called a \"divertissement\".",

I guess they have the ones that are mounted on big trucks - and those trucks share a lot in common with cars, you know steering wheels, engines, tires, and the soon-to-be-anachronistic internal combustion engine. Anyway, if you don't like the bass you can pretty easily EQ it to a reasonable level, or buy the stems and remix it yourownself.

At 3:40 the piece finds it?s stride with pulsating synthesizer effects and a rumbling bass line. Best used as accompaniment for a tense, difficult level of a game or as the final battle with a villain.
